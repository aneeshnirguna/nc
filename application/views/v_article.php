						<p>Can you manage your credit cards as deftly as high stakes Vegas dealers handle their playing cards? You can learn how. Credit cards are important financial instruments, but you can also look at them as kind of a game.

We all know people who use their cards irresponsibly to accumulate crushing debt, but if you play this game right, and stay out of debt, you can gain tremendous value from your cards. Here are six really cool tricks that have worked for me.
<br>


	
1. Reconsideration

You have good credit, but somehow your card application is rejected. You can either sit back and wonder about the factors that may have contributed to your denial, or you can take another shot at getting your card approved. The fact is that your initial rejection was probably just some computer's best guess as to your credit worthiness, and it was incapable of considering every important factor. What people don't realize is that you can call your bank, speak to a human being, and ask him or her to reconsider.
<br>
When you reach your bank, remind the representative of your excellent payment history. You can also offer to reduce your credit line or close other accounts you may have with them. Recently I was able to get approved for a card by closing another card account that I had with them that I was going to cancel anyway. Banks desperately want your business, and they are anxiously waiting for you to call up and offer them a good reason for them to approve you.
<br><br>
2. Bonus Bumping<br>

Have you ever applied for a credit card only to find out later that there was a better sign-up bonus offer available? Like reconsideration, you can contact your bank, inform them of the other offer, and ask them to apply it to your account. To their customer service representative, it's as easy as changing the "promo code" field on their computer screen. While you can do this over the phone, many prefer to log into their bank's website and send a secure message. By doing this, you'll have the bank's response in writing, so there will be no dispute over how many points or miles you should receive.<br>

3. Threaten a Chargeback<br>

I can't tell you how many consumers I have met who have engaged in extended battles to get their money back from unscrupulous merchants. They call, argue, and even yell at the representatives of merchants in a time consuming and often-futile attempt to get a refund. If you paid with your credit card, you should only waste your time on a single call that is escalated to a supervisor. If that person is unwilling to refund your money, inform him or her that you intend to request a chargeback from your credit card issuer.
<br>
Retailers live in fear of the increased merchant fees that result from a chargeback, and they will often reconsider their position the moment they hear that word. Otherwise, a quick call to your bank will result in a temporary credit that will become permanent once you provide documentation supporting your claim.<br><br>

4. Double Your Sign-Up Bonus<br>

Real credit card gurus live for those amazing sign-up bonuses that come around every now and then. Have your spouse or partner apply for the same card. Or sign up for the business version of the card, too. Just as long as you have no temptation to spend more, there is little to lose and a lot to potentially gain.
